# CodSoft Internship Tasks and Concepts

During the virtual internship at  [CodSoft](https://www.codsoft.in), a range of Java programming tasks was successfully completed alongside the study of key concepts. Here's an overview of these tasks and concepts:

## Tasks

### Task 1: Number Game Development

- A number game was developed that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number.
- Java was utilized for creating the game logic, user interaction, and feedback mechanisms.

### Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

- A student grade calculator was designed and implemented to compute total marks, average percentages, and assign grades based on performance.
- Proficiency in Java programming for mathematical operations and conditional statements was demonstrated.

### Task 3: ATM Interface

- An ATM interface was crafted to enable users to check balances, deposit money, and withdraw funds.
- Expertise in user interaction, input handling, and exception management in Java was showcased.

### Task 4: Student Course Registration System

- A student course registration system was developed to allow students to enroll and drop courses.
- Data structures and collections (e.g., ArrayList) were implemented for efficient course management.

## Concepts Studied

During the internship, essential Java programming concepts were studied, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Modularity
- User Interaction and Input Handling
- Data Structures and Collections
- Error Handling and Exception Management
- Game Development and Logic

Excitement abounds for the continued exploration of the world of Java and software engineering.
